# PythonCalculator

The Project: Python Calculator that involves basic syntax to refine memorization of syntax

What I will learn(attempt):
    Basic Syntax
    Documentation
    Refining Syntax and Clear Code

What I will avoid:
    Copy and Paste Code
    ChatGPT and Copying

Project Details:
    This is a calculator that when run will pop up a window as if it was a simple calculator
    the screen will show empty when button with numbers is clicked show numbers, when +-*/ show screen and compute data
    return the calculated variable and show screen
    there will be a clear button and undo button

Additional Notes:
    Basic Math only
    GUI: tkinter

Key Notes:

This Was Created with ChatGPT
- No video was used to create the program
- Simulating Prompt Engineering
- ChatGPT provided direction

Things Learned from This Project
- Productivity was increased due to ChatGPT optimizing code as I was coding originally
- Learn the use of prompt engineering and how productivity can be increase
